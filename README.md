# Brilliant.org community scraper
Used to scrape the Community problems page for all its' content.

Please ensure the ".contributions.cache" file is in your working directory so you don't have to re-scrape all the (28,272) contributions' urls again. It takes ~1 hour.

Side Note: Unknown if this is all of them. But this is where mine ended.
